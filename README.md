## Background:

Formula 1 (F1) is a globally renowned sport that demands cutting-edge technology and data-driven decisions. To meet the growing complexity of team operations, we propose developing an advanced F1 Team Management Systemâ€”a centralized database solution tailored to the unique needs of F1 teams.

This system will utilize relational databases to store and manage critical data such as driver profiles, telemetry, race statistics, car configurations, budgets, and sponsorship records. Features like SQL querying, data normalization, and efficient indexing will ensure optimal performance for real-time data retrieval and analysis.

Additionally, the system will integrate functionalities for role-based access control, transaction management, and data warehousing to support decision-making processes and cross-departmental collaboration. By leveraging modern database architectures, the F1 Team Management System will enhance operational efficiency, support predictive analytics, and empower teams to adapt swiftly to Formula 1's dynamic demands.

## Project Description:

Develop a database system using SQL to efficiently manage and organize data for key entities. The system will support streamlined data operations and ensure seamless integration of these entities to meet the functional requirements of an online retail platform. It will also use generative AI to analyze the stored data to help the manager make better decisions.
